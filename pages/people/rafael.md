I am Rafael, a PhD student at Loughborough University London. I have background on Informatics Engineering from the University of Coimbra, in Portugal, and a MSc on Cybersecurity and Big Data from the Lougborough University London, UK. I am particularly interested in anything that relates to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. I am also interested on studying the problems of applying simulated knowledge to real applications.
