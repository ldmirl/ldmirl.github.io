I'm an IDT CS student, interested in how knowledge learnt within deep multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms can be decomposed into reusable components for life-long learning. I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from Concordia University, Montr√©al and a MSc in Cyber Security and Artifical Intelligence from Lougborough University London. Prior to joining Loughborough University London, I interned at Thales Avionics, working on integrating Augmented Reality (AR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control.
